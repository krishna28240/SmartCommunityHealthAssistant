# Smart Community Health Assistant

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI-based assistant that helps community members track local health alerts...


An AI-based assistant that helps community members track local health alerts, symptoms, and resources. It analyzes public health data to give personalized advice and early warnings.
Building AI course project.

Background

This project addresses the challenge of timely access to relevant health information in local communities. Many people miss updates about outbreaks, vaccination drives, or local health events.

Limited access to localized health data

Difficulty in monitoring personal health against community trends

Need for early warning and preventive guidance

Personal motivation: I want to help people stay informed and take proactive steps for their health. Public health awareness is crucial, and AI can assist in delivering timely, actionable information.

How is it used?

The assistant can be used via a mobile or web interface. Users input their symptoms or concerns, and the AI suggests preventive measures, local clinics, or alerts about ongoing health issues.

Environment: Community health monitoring

Users: Residents of the community, local health workers

Needs considered: Accessibility, privacy, clarity of information

Example code snippet:

def main():
    symptoms = ['fever', 'cough', 'fatigue']
    alerts = ['flu outbreak', 'dengue risk']
    
    for symptom in symptoms:
        print(f"Checking local health alerts for {symptom}...")
    
    for alert in alerts:
        print(f"Community alert: {alert}")

main()

Data sources and AI methods

Public health APIs (e.g., WHO, local health departments)

Community reports collected via forms

AI techniques: Natural Language Processing to understand symptom descriptions, classification models to match symptoms to local alerts

Syntax	Description
API	Fetch health alerts from official sources
NLP	Process user-reported symptoms
Classification	Map symptoms to local health risks
Challenges

Cannot replace medical professionals

Limited by data availability and accuracy

Must respect privacy and consent when handling personal health data

What next?

Add predictive analytics for outbreak likelihood

Expand to cover more communities and languages

Integrate with wearable devices for real-time monitoring
